# Machine Learning

## Prediction Target
- This is defined as y in a model
- This is the value that you want to model to predict hense the name

## Features
- This is defined as X
- Columns that are put into the model to predict the value we are looking for
- Depends on the model you are building for the best number of features

## Building a model
1. Define: What type of model will it be? A decision Tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
2. Fit: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of the model
3. Predict: Just what it sounds like
4. Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's prediction are.

# sklearn.tree (Python) 
- A library in python for building a tree model AI


## DecisionTreeRegressor
- This is a type of tree 
- Didn't go into much detail on how the model works
- Makes sure to have an argument for random_state to get the same results everytime


# Pandas Functions (Python)

## dropna
- Drops values from the dataset

## data_set.column_name
- Pulls that one column from the data set with all the rows values

## head
- Gives the first few rows of the data set

## fit
- Fits the features and prediction target to the model

## predict
- Predicts the prediction target values based on the features that were given to it
